    The failure array of s is an array P of length n for which P[k] is 
    the length of the longest substring s[j:k] that is equal to some
    prefix s[1:kâˆ’j+1], where j cannot equal 1 (otherwise, P[k] would always
    equal k). By convention, P[1]=0.

Given: A DNA string s (of length at most 100 kbp) in FASTA format.

Return: The failure array of s.
